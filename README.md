## ⎔ Feature Architecture

* **System Dashboard:** Displays live churn risk scores across every account with quick filters for plan tier and risk level. Includes animated KPI cards and a responsive, color-coded bar chart that updates instantly as you filter data.
* **Customer Intelligence Center:** A sortable, searchable data table equipped with mini sparkline trends, risk bars, and plan badges. Clicking any row expands an inline detail panel containing six deep-dive stats, a risk gauge, and a visual journey stage indicator.
* **Pipeline Journey Map:** Outlines customer status across a four-stage pipeline: *Active, At-Risk, Critical, and Expired*. Teams can click any stage to inspect the exact cohort profile, individual risk scores, and the overall health rating of that segment.
* **Lifecycle Timeline:** A carousel interface holding every customer profile in the dataset. Selecting a user lets you scroll through a three-act narrative tracking their engagement decline, backed by a sticky profile card that morphs seamlessly between Active, Warning, and Critical states using Framer Motion.
* **Automated Alert Center:** Highlights the high-priority accounts needing a phone call today. Features a terminal-style panel that drafts personalized retention emails on demand, generated live by Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model.

## λ Predictive Logic & Data Flow

```text
[Customer Data] ──> [scikit-learn Scoring] ──> [Real-Time Risk Score] ──> [Groq · Llama 3.3 70B] ──> [Personalized Email]
```

1. **Predictive Modeling:** The scoring layer evaluates customer signals — contract value, time since last contact, and days until renewal — to produce a 0–100 churn risk score and a lifecycle stage for every account in real time.
2. **AI Copy Generation:** Renewal emails are drafted on demand by Groq's **Llama 3.3 70B** model, personalized per account using the company name, software, contract expiry, value, and account manager. If the AI service is unavailable, the engine falls back to a deterministic local template so a usable draft is always produced.

## ⚠️ Deployment Notes

The frontend lives on **Vercel** and the backend is hosted on **Render**.

The backend uses a lightweight **SQLite** database that is automatically initialized and seeded from `clients.csv` on every startup. This keeps the live demo populated with a consistent dataset even on Render's ephemeral free-tier disk, so there's never an empty dashboard. Because that disk resets whenever the instance sleeps, records added through the live UI are not retained long-term — ideal for a clean, repeatable demo.

Because the backend runs on a free-tier instance, it spins down into a sleep state after a period of inactivity. The initial request can take roughly **60 to 90 seconds** while the container provisions. Subsequent requests execute instantly.

↳ **Pro-Tip:** To pre-warm the backend right before a live presentation, visit: `https://retainiq-thunderhacks-2026.onrender.com/api/customers`
